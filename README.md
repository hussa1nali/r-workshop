# r-workshop
Repo for R workshop
This Repo is for my R learning workshop
We use the following data from the Santa Barbara Coastal Term Ecological Research and National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in our analyses
#load tidyverse and readxl
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here) #here() starts at Y:/R/r-workshop
#load excel file from data folder
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))
#create a line graph of visitors to Channel Islands National Park
ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_line()
#store the first line as object gg_base so that we donâ€™t need to retype it each time:
gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors))
#e.g.use the stored variable and change plot style
gg_base +
  geom_point()
#changing the aesthetics
gg_base +
  geom_line(
    color = "tan2",
    linetype = "solid"
  )
#changing the aesthetics based on values
gg_base + 
  geom_point(
    aes(size = visitors,
        color = visitors),
    alpha = 0.5
  )
#adding title and axis labels
gg_base +
  geom_line(linetype = "dotted") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Annual park visitors",
    title = "Channel Islands NP Visitation",
    subtitle = "(1963 - 2016)"
  )
#combining two graph components
gg_base +
  geom_line(color = "black") +
  geom_point(color = "orange",
